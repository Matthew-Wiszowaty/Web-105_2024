                Ever since I was a kid, I have loved to go cycling.
                I use cycling as my main method of cardio and
                I also use it to explore new places and find new routes.
                My current bike is a Trek FX 1 and I swapped the standard flat bars 
                for drop bars found on many higher end road bikes. I have put about 
                300 miles on it since I swapped the bars and I love it. I am also saving
                up for a nicer bike similar to the Specialized SL6 Tarmac in the picture
                on the right and in a similar budget. I unfortunately do not see my current
                bike surviving my riding patterns for much longer as after one summer of 300
                moderately hard miles the chain has drastically stretched and the rear derailleur
                gear bearings are starting to seize. However, those parts are not iincredibly difficult to replace.
