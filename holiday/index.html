        <p>A trend of valentines day is to give 
            flowers and chocolates to your loved one. This is a 
            tradition that has been around for 
            many years and many countries around 
            the world participate in this holiday.

        <p>I usually just treat this day like any
            other day. I don't really celebrate it. 
            I think it's a good day to show your 
            loved one that you care about them, but 
            I dont have a partner to celebrate it with yet.

        <p>I hope to have a partner to celebrate 
            valentines day with in the future. I think 
            it would be a fun day to celebrate with 
            someone you love. I hope to be able to 
            give them flowers and chocolates and 
            show them how much I care about them.
