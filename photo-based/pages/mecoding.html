                <p>I first started learning to code when I saw my dad make a pong game on a raspberry pi after he bought an arcade kit for one. 
                    I was amazed by the fact that it is possible to make a gaming console that easily. I started by taking classes in
                    High School with a focus on computers and programming. Now I am going towards a computer science degree or a degree involved 
                    in application and software development. I am currently learning HTML and CSS, and I am excited to learn more about coding and 
                    program development.

                <p>This is my first actually edited video. It is a montage of some of my better clips from the game known as Rainbow Six Siege.
                    I am proud of this video because it is the first time I have ever edited a video and I think it turned out pretty well considering 
                    it was me learning the software alone. It took a little while to import the clips and sort through them to find the best clips to fill 
                    the length of the song I chose. The song is called "SUKA SUKA" by a group called BRUTALISMUS 3000. I inserted the clips into the software 
                    and cut them so that there was only action and no downtime. At first I had no idea what transition to use so I just used crossfader which 
                    looked the best. The song may be a little loud so I would recommend turning down your volume before watching the video.
