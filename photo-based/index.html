            <p class="h2">About this Project</p>
            <p>
                This peer-reviewed project entails creating a resume or 
                portfolio website with a minimum of 5 pages, each containing 
                at least 100 words of original content and six images. The website must 
                include navigation to all other pages, an original title tag, 
                H1 and H2 tags, floats, IDs, classes, header, nav, footer, 
                main elements, and an external stylesheet for all styles. 
                Additionally, variables and Google Fonts must be utilized. 
                The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and 
                web design principles while showcasing the creator's skills and 
                accomplishments in a professional manner.

            <p class="h2"> The Process of Coding</p>
            <p>This is all filler to make the website look better. <br>
                Coding a website or any software program is a meticulous yet 
                exhilarating journey that unfolds through layers of logic, creativity, 
                and problem-solving. It all begins with a blank canvas, a pristine code 
                editor waiting to be filled with lines of commands and structures that 
                will breathe life into digital realms. The process often commences with 
                thorough planning and analysis, where concepts are shaped into comprehensive 
                strategies and wireframes. Then, armed with programming languages like HTML, 
                CSS, JavaScript, Python, or others depending on the project's requirements, 
                developers embark on crafting the skeleton of the application or website, 
                carefully structuring its layout, styling its elements, and infusing it with 
                interactivity and functionality. This phase is akin to an intricate dance, 
                where each line of code plays a crucial role in defining the user experience. 
                Debugging emerges as a constant companion, as developers meticulously hunt 
                down errors and inconsistencies, ensuring that every function behaves as 
                intended. Collaboration flourishes as teams work in tandem, leveraging 
                version control systems like Git to synchronize their efforts and 
                maintain code integrity. As the project evolves, so do the challenges, 
                pushing developers to continuously innovate and refine their craft. 
                Accessibility, scalability, and security become paramount considerations, 
                as the codebase matures into a robust foundation capable of withstanding 
                the demands of an ever-changing digital landscape. Finally, after rounds 
                of testing, feedback, and refinement, the culmination arrivesâ€”a fully 
                realized website or program ready to be unleashed into the world, a 
                testament to the ingenuity and perseverance of its creators.</p>
